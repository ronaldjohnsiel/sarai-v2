It did not come easy, just as how other ideas did not come over night, the team had to go through to numerous discussions and brainstorming sessions before they reach the eureka moment. Sarai was Abraham’s wife, and she was the first character in the Bible who was said to be barren. But then later on, God chose them to be the forefathers of the nation of Israel.\nIt was a miracle, of how Sarai was able to conceive. So the team thought it apt to adopt the name, thus the name Project SARAi came about. Project SARAi hopes to bring about development in our agriculture sector by providing our farmers with smarter options. Also, Project SARAi hopes to help in making a more resilient and a more proactive agriculture sector by using state-of-the-art technologies, and providing near real-time crop advisories.\nIt is a long work in progress, but with the sustained partnership with different State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) nationwide, different government agencies, and other institutions, the solutions are well along the way to reaching the farmers and other stakeholders.',

Decreasing agricultural lands, limited water and fertilizer and environmental threats are some of the challenges agriculture industry. Closing existing yield gaps is one key strategy in meeting food demand [ CITATION Fol11 l 1033 ]. </p><p>Yield gap refers to the difference between the average farmers’ (actual) yield and attainable yield (without nutrient and water limitations) [ CITATION Lab12 l 1033 ]. Some reasons, but not limited to, include farmers’ characteristics, farm site characteristics, and technology available within the area. Analysis of yield gap can aid in determining expected increase in yield by alleviating observed constraints [ CITATION Bol11 l 1033 ].  Knowledge on yield gaps can help in (i) prioritizing locations and needs for agricultural research and development; (ii) assessing the effectiveness and impact of introduced technologies; or (iii) evaluate the impact of future scenarios, such as climate change [ CITATION Als09 l 1033 ].</p><h3>Objectives</h3><ul><li>To determine the gap between attainable and actual rice yields in 8 major lowland-rice producing areas (Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Laguna, Oriental Mindoro, Iloilo, Bukidnon, North Cotabato and Davao del Sur).</li><li>To identify the yield-limiting constraints within the areas.</li><li>To develop decision-support system on rice integrated crop management (R-ICM) for the selected areas.</li></ul><h3>Activities</h3><ul><li>Nutrient  management study</li><li>Baseline survey</li></ul><h3>Expected Outputs</h3>  <ul><li>Yield-limiting factors in 8 major lowland-rice producing sites identified.</li><li>Decision-support system for rice developed.</li>       </ul><h3>Methodology</h3><p>The study make use of the data generated from the Variety x Nutrient Interaction experiment under Project 1 – Study 2. Variety x environment interaction was analyzed using the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model. The AMMI model analysis was performed using the SAS University Edition (SAS Institute Inc., 2014) software program. </p><p>Analysis of variance was done between locations and seasons for the effect of temperature. Comparison of treatment means was performed based on Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) Test. Pearson correlation analysis was also done to determine the association between GDD and yield. The same procedures were done in water-use efficiency. </p><p>Characterization of farmers’ field production practices and productivity was done by baseline survey. Results from experiment and baseline survey will be used in the development of decision-support system. Identification of farmer respondents were done. Respondents are from the adjacent areas near the experiment sites.</p><p>Baseline survey has two main factors; socio-economic and crop management and practices. Socio-economic factors include household size, farm assets, access to credit and risk aversion. Crop management and production practices include land preparation, variety, crop establishment, planting time, water availability, nutrient management, crop protection, harvest management, and post-harvest management. </p>',

        about: '<h2>Tungkol sa Mais</h2><p>Mais ang pangalawa sa pangunahing pananim sa ating bansa. 60% ng mais na itinatanim sa Pilipinas ay ginagamit para maging pakain sa mga hayop at 40% naman ay ginagamit na pagkain o panghalili sa kanin. Ayon sa Kagawaran ng Pagsasaka, mahigit kumulang sa 600,000 ng mga magsasaka ang nakadepende sa mais bilang pangunahing hanapbuhay. Bukod sa mga magsasaka, kumikita rin ang iba’t ibang sektor ng lipunan tulad ng transportasyon sa pagpoproseso at pagbebenta ng mais.</p><p>Subalit noong 2011, ayon sa National Corn Program ng Kagawaran ng Pagsasaka, hindi sapat ang suplay ng mais sa ating bansa. Kung ikukumpara sa mga bansang Thailand, Argentina, Estados Unidos, at iba pang mga bansang nagtatanim ng mais, nahuhuli ang Pilipinas sa average corn productivity na 3.21 metric tons/hectare (mt/ha). Sa kasalukyan, ayon kay Dr. Art Salazar ay sapat na ang suplay ng mais sa ating bansa.</p><p>Isa sa mga tinuturing na dahilan ng pagbaba ng produksyon ng mais sa ating bansa ay ang pababago-bagong klima na nagdudulot ng mga kalamidad tulad ng bagyo at tagtuyot. Ang pamumugad din ng mga insekto ay isa rin sa mga dahilan ng pagbaba ng produksyon ng mais at ng mas madalas na paggamit ng pestisidyo. Ang corn borer at corn plant hopper ang mga halimbawa ng insekto na namumugad sa mga taniman ng mais. Bukod dito, ang pagkakaroon ng sakit ng mga halaman tulad ng corn rust, corn downy mildew, at corn leaf spot at ang regular na paggamit ng kemikal ng mga magsasaka ay nakaka-apekto rin sa produksyon ng mais sa ating bansa.</p><p>Sources:</p><p><strong>Agri-pinoy corn program.

        about: '<h2>Tungkol sa Saging</h2><p>Ang saging ay pang-apat sa pinakamalaking industriya ng prutas sa mundo. Mahigit 120 bansang tropical at <i> sub-tropical </i> and nagtatanim nito (Valmayor et al., 2002). Sa mga prutas sa Pilipinas, ang saging ang may pinakamalaking kontribusyon sa ekonomiya. Noong taong 2009, umabot milyong metriko tonelada ang produksiyon ng saging sa Pilipinas (BAS, 2010). Ang bansa ay pang-apat sa may pinakamalaking produksiyon ng saging sa buong mundo; pangalawa sa pagluluwas ng Cavendish, at una sa banana chips sa pandaigdigang pamilihan.</p><p>  Ang saging ay isa sa iilang prutas na mabibili anumang panahon. Mabuti ito sa kalusugan, masarap at abot-kaya ang halaga. Ang saging ay mayaman sa enerhiya, <i>dietary fiber</i>, <i>potassium</i>, <i>phosphorous</i>, <i>Vitamin A, B, C</i> at iba pang mahahalagang mineral. Wala itong taba, <i>cholesterol</i> o <i>sodium</i> na maaaring makasama sa kalusugan. Subalit sa kabila ng malalaking potensiyal na kontribusyon ng saging sa nutrisyon at seguridad sa pagkain ng mga Pilipino, mababa pa rin ang konsumo natin sa saging kumpara sa pang araw-araw na pangangailangan ng ating katawan. Sa 400 gramo na rekomendadong pagkain ng prutas at gulay, bumaba ang konsumo ng Pilipino mula 104 gramo noong 1978 sa 54 gramo noong 2003 (Pedro et al., 2003). Sa isang pandaigdigang pag-aaral, tinatayang mahigit sa 75% ng mga Pilipino ang nasa ibaba ng rekomendadong konsumo ng prutas at gulay (Hall et al., 2009).</p><p>Makikita ang saging saan mang sulok ng bansa. Ito ay itinatanim sa mga kapatagan—tubigan man o linang, burol at bulubunduking lugar. Ito ay itinatanim bilang <i> monocrop </i> at popular ding kasama ng ibang puno at halaman. Ang saging ang pinakapopular na salit-tanim sa mga niyugan.</p><p>Halos 75% ng mga magsasaging ay maliliit ang taniman o nasa likod-bahay lamang. Ang mga ito ang karaniwang tinatamnan ng mga lokal na uri ng saging gaya ng Saba, Lakatan at Latundan. Kadalasan, ang mga tanim na saging ay pulu-pulutong, kalat at halos hindi inaalagaan. Tinatawag ngang “kundiman” ang pangangalaga nito—kundi man gamasan, kundi man diligan, kundi man abonohan.</p><p>Mahigit 40% ng taniman ng saging sa Pilipinas (180,000 ektarya) anf may produksiyong mababa sa 10 tonelada kada ektarya bawat taon. Lubhang mababa ito kung ikukumpara sa mga lugar sa Mindanao na may mga plantasyon ng Cavendish na umaani ng hanggang 50 tonelada kada ektarya bawat taon (BAS, 2009).</p><p>Patunay ang mga plantasyon sa Mindanao na ang sagingang inaalagaa ng wasto ay magbibigay ng magandang ani at malaking kita. Ang tamang pangangalaga na sinimulan sa tamang pagpili ng lugar, uri ng pananim. Maagap na pagsugpo ng mga peste at sakit, pagkontrol ng bilang ng suwi, pagpapanatiling malinis ng taniman, tamang pag-aabono, patubig at pagbabalot ng bunga, ay maaaring magbigay ng malaki at magandang kalidad ng bunga (Van den Bergh at Molina, 2007).</p><p>Maganda ang potensiyal ng ating mga lokal na saging para pagkakitaan ng ating maliliit na magsasaka. Marami rin itong ibang gamit bukod sa pagkain. Tulad ng puno ng niyog, bawat parte ng puno ng saging ay kapaki-pakinabang. Ngunit sa dami ng sakit at pesteng umaatake rito, kailangan nang mabago ang sistema ng pagtatanim at pangangalaga nito. May mga teknolohiyan napatunayan nang makapagpapataas ng produksiyon ng lokal na klase ng saging.</p>',
